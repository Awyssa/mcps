`description`: `Brothers and sisters, gather 'round, for I must speak of a scourge that haunts our daily existence - the blinding, relentless assault of white pixels upon our weary retinas.

Picture this: You open the admin app at 2 AM to check on a critical issue. Your room is dark, your eyes adjusted to the gentle embrace of shadow. Then BAM! A supernova of white light erupts from your screen, searing itself into your corneas like a thousand tiny daggers of luminescence. You recoil, temporarily blinded, questioning every life choice that brought you to this moment of ocular agony.

But it's not just about the immediate pain, my friends. Oh no. The white light is insidious. It disrupts our circadian rhythms, stealing precious sleep from our bodies. It causes eye strain, fatigue, and headaches that plague us throughout the day. Studies show that prolonged exposure to bright screens in dark environments can lead to digital eye strain, reduced blink rates, and even potential long-term vision problems.

Now imagine - just imagine - an alternative reality. You open the admin app and are greeted by a sophisticated palette of grays and blacks, punctuated by carefully chosen accent colors that guide rather than assault. Your pupils relax. Your brain sighs with relief. You can work for hours without feeling like you've stared into the sun.

Dark mode isn't just a feature - it's a philosophy. It's ergonomic. It's energy-efficient. It's professional. It's the choice of developers, designers, and night owls everywhere who have seen the light... by embracing the dark.

The path is clear. The solution is simple. Dark mode is not just a nice-to-have; it is the singular path to glory, the beacon of hope in our screen-saturated world.

Let us cast aside the tyranny of blinding white backgrounds and step boldly into the sophisticated embrace of dark mode. Our eyes - and our souls - will thank us.`
